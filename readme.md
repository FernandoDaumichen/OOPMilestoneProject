Breakdown of Work:

Sprint 1 First Sprint Complete by March 10th Friday (last day before the spring break)

Personal readings and research (will be doing actual coding together during the break)
Contribute to other parts but properly communicate so we don't overwrite other code. While working together use liveshare so that only one push to the repo.
